      Taylor Polynomials take local linear approximations and expand them so that the approximation is more 
      accurate. As a reminder, Local Linear Approximations involve taking the derivative of a function at a 
      point a and using the tangent line to find the approximate value of numbers very close to the function. 
      This works because functions behave in a linear function over extremely small intervals. However, notice 
      that the Local Linear approximation is written in slope-intercept form: $$f(x)f'(x)(x-a)+f(a).$$So there is 
      another way of thinking about this function. Let’s flip it using the commutative property: 
      $$f(x)f(a)+f'(x)(x-a)$$.Notice that the first value, \(f(a)\),specifies the y-value of the function. 
      So if you used only that, you would get a horizontal line that crosses \(f(x)\) at \(x=a\). This is itself an 
      approximation for points around, although not a very accurate one.  By taking the derivative, we can get 
      a more accurate version. So how can we make a Local Linear Approximation more accurate? Well, 
      consider that a Local Linear approximation is linear-a line. The reason it fails so quickly is 
      because nonlinear functions curve. So what if our approximation curves too?

    <p class="">
      Taylor Polynomials do this. Essentially, they take the local linear approximation and add terms 
      at higher derivatives, thus turning the approximating function into a more accurate approximation. 
      A first degree Taylor polynomial is therefore a local linear approximation. A second-degree Taylor 
      polynomial would take the local linear approximation and add to it the second derivative of that 
      function. Graphically, this would match the concavity of the function. However, we cannot just add 
      the second derivative and call it a day. Just like the local linear approximation is a line in 
      slope-intercept form, the second-degree Taylor polynomial is quadratic. Of course, we can’t just 
      plug in the second derivative and call it a day. In order for that approximation to work, the 
      quadratic we construct has to, at the very least, equal \(f''(x)\) at \(x=a\). Mathematically, that means 
      that our quadratic $$f(x)c1(x-a)2+c2(x-a)+c3$$ must have a second derivative that equals \(f''(a)\) at \(x=a\). 
      Notice that the \(c2\) and \(c3\) terms disappear as we take derivatives, leaving only the a term, which, 
      after taking the derivative twice, equals \(2c1\). Notice that the \(c2\) and \(c3\) terms are a local linear 
      approximation, as established earlier, so the function can be rewritten as $$f(x)c1(x-a)2+f'(a)(x-a)+f(a).$$
      It follows logically then that \(c1=f''(x)\), so in order for the second derivatives to match, 
      the \(c1\) term must be halved, creating the final second-degree approximation of 
      $$f(x)f''(a)2(x-a)2+f'(a)(x-a)+f(a).$$ Finally, notice that the reason why the second derivative is 
      divided by two is because of the power rule, so that the constant in front of the constant term is 
      equal to \(2!\), as opposed to just the number two. If we were to expand this to a third-degree polynomial, 
      the constant term that we would have to cancel out would be \(123=3!\),and the third-degree approximation 
      would be, when written out, $$f(x)f(a)+f'(x)1!(x-a)+f''(a)2!(x-a)2+f'''(x)3!(x-a)3.$$
